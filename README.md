# rainPod
##About
iPod themed music player for Rainmeter
##Customizing
To customize **rainPod** right-click on the skin, select _Edit skin_ and edit the `[Variables]` section in **rainPod.ini**.
###Color
Available color are **grey**, **pink** **green** or **blue**. Just assign your prefered color to the `MyColor` variable. Have a look at the following example:
```ini
MyColor=green
```
###Music player
The skin was developed and tested using iTunes. For other available and supported music players have a look at the offical Rainmeter **[docs](http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/plugins/nowplaying#playerlist)**. To change this value just assign your prefered music player to the `MyPlayer` variable like this:
```ini
MyPlayer=iTunes
```
###Size
The default height of this skin is **350px**. If you want to resize the music player you can do this by assigning your prefered height to the `MyHeight` variable. At the moment I recommend not to go beyond the default value. Bigger is no problem.
```ini
MyHeight=350
```
